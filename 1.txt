ining  the  neural  substrate  of  olfaction,  simple  chemical  
odorants were presented to anesthetized and awake dogs 
( Jia et al., 2014). This study used a mixture of ethyl butyr-
ate, eugenol, and carvone, which is reported to smell like 
pineapple, cloves, spearmint, and caraway. Primary olfac-
tory cortex was activated in both awake and anesthetized 
dogs; however, differential neural activation to different 
odors was discernible only in awake dogs. Studies such 
as these support the value of awake imaging and provide 
the groundwork for future examinations of the biological 
substrate of odor detection and processing in canines.
Unlike  simple  derived  chemical  odorants,  biological  
scents contain a mixture of odors and pheromones that 
are intrinsically salient to the dog and donâ€™t require much 
training to discriminate. Like many mammals, dogs have a 
vomeronasal  organ  (VNO)  in  the  roof  of  the  mouth  
(Adams  &  Wiekamp,  1984).  The  VNO  is  specialized  for  
the  detection  of  pheromones  and  projects  to  the  acces-
sory  olfactory  bulb  (Salazar,  Barber,  &  Cifuentes,  1992).  
Using biological odors from both humans and dogs, our 
group found significant activation in olfactory cortex, sim-
ilar to that found with arbitrary odorants (Berns, Brooks, 
& Spivak, 2015). However, when the brain responses to 
different dimensions of the biological scents were exam-
ined (e.g., dog vs. human and familiar vs. unfamiliar), the 
ventral striatum was found to be significantly more active 
in response to the scent of the familiar human. In other 
words, the smell of a familiar human, with no attendant 
food reward, activated reward systems in dogs. The smell 
of unfamiliar humans, and familiar and unfamiliar dogs, 
did not. These results underscore the unique social bond 
between dogs and their primary human companions.
In  the  domain  of  auditory  perception,  one  study  has  
shown that similar brain regions in humans and dogs are
